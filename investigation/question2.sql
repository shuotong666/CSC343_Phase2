-- What is the relationship between a countryâ€™s GDP, HDI level, coronavirus death counts? (can't find data on hospitalization for covid19 (the data provided by the set is a general hospitalization)) 
-- More developed countries usually have better healthcare systems (hospital beds, life expectancy) and easier access to personal protection equipment (PPE).

-- population density vs. total cases rising rate
-- aged_65_older vs. fatality_rate and diagnosis_rate (= total_cases/population)
